      Hi! My name is Melanie Malek. My experience in web design began during my first 
      year of university where I developed a dynamic marketing website for the course 
      SEG2900. My design process is thoughtful and user-centered. I begin by understanding 
      the user's needs, then move into prototyping before refining the visual style to 
      ensure accessibility and clarity. I aim for clean, modern interfaces that are both 
      functional and aesthetically pleasing. I'm currently expanding my skills through a 
      user interface design course, where I'm learning more about design principles, usability, 
      and accessibility. This portfolio showcases my journey in learning and applying best practices 
      in UI design.
